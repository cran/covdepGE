Description: A covariate-dependent approach to Gaussian graphical modeling as described in Dasgupta et al. (2022). Employs a novel weighted pseudo-likelihood approach to model the conditional dependence structure of data as a continuous function of an extraneous covariate. The main function, covdepGE::covdepGE(), estimates a graphical representation of the conditional dependence structure via a block mean-field variational approximation, while several auxiliary functions (inclusionCurve(), matViz(), and plot.covdepGE()) are included for visualizing the resulting estimates.
